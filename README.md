Many people go into programming for money, others for status.  
For me, **programming is a science**.  
I want to create **new algorithms**, **innovative projects**, and **game-changing products**.

I chose the hard path — rejecting business and corporate success — in favor of my path as a **scientist**.  
This journey is about **discovery**, **creativity**, and **growth**.
